These examples show how to use Racket OpenCV.

* SimpleImageProcessing.rkt
- open a test image
- get its parameters (size, depth, channels)
- change region of interest (ROI) of the image that will be used in image processing
- erode image inside the ROI
- set ROI back enclose the whole image
- get intensity values of all pixels as Racket bytes
- invert the image /in Racket/
- visualize resulting image
- wait for user to press a key and exit

* VideoSimple.rkt
This example shows how to open a camera, to set camera resolution to 640x480 pixels, and to capture video in a window.
The program terminates upon a key press.

* VideoSobel.rkt
This example applies sobel edge detection onto a video stream.
