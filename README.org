This project is an attempt to port OpenCV library to Racket by using the [[http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/index.html?q=ctype&q=_cpointer&q=make-cvector&q=time*&q=time&q=yield][Racket Foreign Interface]].
In the beginning I will try to provide some basic functionality that I use myself.
Later on, I might port the rest.


* My System
- Mac OS X 10.7.3
- Racket v5.2.1, Intel 64-Bit
- OpenCV @2.3.1a, 64-Bit, downloaded and compiled through MacPorts
