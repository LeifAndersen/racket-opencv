This project ports a subset of the OpenCV C library to Racket by using the [[http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/index.html?q=ctype&q=_cpointer&q=make-cvector&q=time*&q=time&q=yield][Racket Foreign Interface]].
Names of OpenCV structures and functions have been left unchanged, i.e., C function cvCaptureFromCAM(int index) can be used in Racket as (cvCaptureFromCAM index).


* Reference System
- Mac OS X 10.7.3
- Racket v5.2.1, Intel 64-Bit
- OpenCV @2.3.1a, 64-Bit, downloaded and compiled through MacPorts
